# Permutations in the English Dictionary

Write a Java program that prints all permutations of a string provided that the permutation is a word in the English dictionary.  You will be provided a text file containing 355k English words.

Allow a user to be able to enter the string as a command-line arguement.

An example of a terminal command using input redirection to run the program is `java Permutations < wordsEn.txt demo`.  This would return `[demo, dome, mode]`.
